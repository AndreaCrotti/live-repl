# Live REPLing for fun and profit

Showcase project for different kind of live REPLs, how to connect to them and various related tips&tricks.

You can run the project either the [run.sh](./run.sh) script in three ways:
- `./run.sh docker` (builds a docker image and runs it)
- `./run.sh jar` (runs from the jar file)
- `./run.sh` (runs directly with `clj`)

This project can then be used to showcase the different REPLs and how reloading works.
